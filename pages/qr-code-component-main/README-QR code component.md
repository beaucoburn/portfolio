## My process

### Built with

- Bootstrap
- CSS custom properties


### Continued development

Really need to continue to develop my CSS skills.  Right now I am basic with my CSS skills and I want to obviously continue to develop them.  Also need to continue to polish my JS skills as well.


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/card/#sizing) - Really relied on Bootstrap Cards to help me to complete this project faster.
